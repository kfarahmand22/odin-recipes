    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Prep your burrito bowl ingredients. Shave the lettuce and set aside, or divide immediately into 4 bowls. Slice the plantains, onions, and peppers and set each aside. Juice the orange and the lime into a small bowl, whisk the cumin and red pepper into the citrus juice, then set aside. Dice the avocado, and set aside. </li>
    <li>Rice the cauliflower. Cut the cauliflower into florets. Add half the cauliflower florets to the bowl of your food processor. Pulse the florets until they are uniformly riced. Scrape out the riced cauliflower into a bowl and set aside. Repeat with the remaining cauliflower florets. </li>
    <li>Cilantro Lime Cauliflower Rice</li>
    <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add the avocado oil, and heat until it shimmers. Add the cauliflower rice and salt. Saute, stirring frequently, until translucent, but not overly soft, 5-6 minutes. Add the lime juice and saute 1 minute longer, stirring continuously. Remove from heat and stir in the lime zest and minced cilantro. </li>
    <li>Paleo Burrito Bowls</li>
    <li>Divide the cauliflower rice evenly between four bowls, then add the shaved romaine lettuce to each burrito bowl.</li>
    <li>Wipe out the skillet, return it to medium high heat, and add one tablespoon of avocado oil. Add the pulled pork to the pan, the pour the citrus juice mixed with the spices over the pork. Allow the pork to sear undisturbed until it’s crispy, and all of the liquid has been absorbed, 10-12 minutes. Remove from heat and divide the pork between the burrito bowls. </li>
    <li>While the pork is cooking, heat a second skillet over medium heat. Add the remaining 2 tbsp avocado oil, or enough to coat the bottom of the skillet in an even later. Heat until the oil shimmers. Working in batches, add the plantain slices in a single layer and fry until golden brown, 2-3 minutes. Flip, and fry on the other side until golden brown, an additional 2-3 minutes. Remove the plantain slices and set them onto a paper towel lined plate, then sprinkle with salt.</li>
    <li>Increase the heat to medium high. Add the onion and a pinch of salt, then toss to coat in the remaining fat. Saute, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and the edges start to brown, 7 minutes. Add the bell pepper to the pan and saute, stirring occasionally, until the peppers are slightly charred, but still retain a soft crunch, 5 minutes. </li>
    <li>Place ¼ of the onions and peppers into each burrito bowl on top of the lettuce and cauliflower rice. </li>
    <li>Finish each burrito bowl with ¼ of the plantains, half a diced avocado, and two tablespoons salsa. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
