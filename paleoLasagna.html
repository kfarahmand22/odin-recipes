    <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>    
    <ol>
    <li>Day before: Soak cashews in water (no need to refrigerate)</li>
    <li> a large pot, add 2 tsp of olive oil and sauté onion and garlic over medium heat, or until onions are tender</li>
    <li>Add Italian sausage and beef in pot, cook until meat is browned</li>
    <li>Drain fat</li>
    <li>Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste</li>
    <li>Add remaining lasagna sauce spices</li>
    <li>Allow sauce to simmer in pot while continuing below (best if simmered 30 mins to 1 hour)</li>
    <li>In a frying pan with a little olive oil, sauté mushrooms (with any kind of seasonings or parsley if you like)</li>
    <li>Set sautéed mushrooms aside</li>
    <li>Place thawed spinach in bowl, squeeze as much water out of it as possible</li>
    <li>Set spinach aside</li>
    <li>Drain water from the soaking cashews, and pour cashews into a food processor</li>
    <li>Add almond milk and spices to the food processor</li>
    <li>Pulse or blend until cashews become a smooth and creamy consistency (something like ricotta cheese)</li>
    <li>Add 2 cups of the cashew “cheese” into the bowl with spinach and blend together</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350º F</li>
    <li>Slice zucchini lengthwise, (first trim two opposite sides so it doesn't roll around on the board) Slice noodles about 1/4-inch thick (works by hand with a knife) don't worry about them all being the exact same thickness</li>
    <li>Get out a 9" x 12" baking dish</li>
    <li>Smooth a little bit of the lasagna sauce along the bottom of the pan</li>
    <li>Place one layer of zucchini noodles lengthwise across the bottom of the pan</li>
    <li>Add about half of cashew cheese and spinach mixture along the top of the zucchini noodles layer</li>
    <li>On top of that, add half of the pan of sautéed mushrooms</li>
    <li>Top with lasagna sauce enough to cover the top (don’t skimp, there’ll be plenty)</li>
    <li>Repeat the above steps with a second layer of zucchini noodles, cashew cheese and spinach, and again with the sautéed mushrooms and lasanga sauce</li>
    <li>Now bake uncovered for about 50-60 minutes (or until it starts to bubble around the edges)</li>
    <li>Remove from oven, let stand a few minutes, slice and serve</li>

</ol>
